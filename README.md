# family-photo-history
My first person project: to chronicle my families history

Please see bottom of document for project proposal.

Per  my google keep notes that I took while on the phone with my dad:

>I want to create a website to archive and organize Pagadaun/Ortaliza family photos.
>They should be able to be tagged/sorted with the following criteria:
>- Person(s) in photo
>- Date taken
>The goal is to have a site user friendly enough for my elderly relatives and aesthetically pleasing as a photo viewing experience.
>
>Feature list (in order of implementation):
>- photo hosting
>- Sort by date
>- Filter by date range
>- Import date from metadata
>- Optional description
>- Tag people in photo
>- Filter by tagged people
>- Scrapbook (album) feature
>- Video hosting
>- filter by video, photo, or album
>- Family tree 
>- Family member birthday and bios"

This is a fairly rudimentary list. I will start with a proof of concept that is based on the features higher on the list.


## Proof of concept

 - Will run on my PC through the VScode local live server extension
 - Will use local images from my phone, and potentially polariod scans
 - Possibly a way to upload images? Right now I don't know how to store images and metadata in a database

 ### Post behavior

 My main goals with the list of posts is to make sure that they all appear uniform, yet still readable. 
 They must also be easy to interact with. 

# Project Proposal: Family Album Website for Sharing Family History

## Mission Statement and Introduction
The goal of this project is to provide a website where family, especially those who are older and may have trouble seeing and using technology, can share information about family history, primarily through pictures.

## Objectives:
- Create a website that is easy to use and accessible to all family members, regardless of age or technical ability.
- Develop a platform where family members can upload and view photos, videos, and other media related to family history.
- Implement a search functionality that allows family members to search for specific images based on date, location, and people.
- Allow family members to comment and share memories about the images, creating a collaborative and interactive space.
- Ensure the privacy and security of family members' personal information and media.

## Scope:
The website will be developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Node.js. The website will be hosted on a cloud-based server and will use a MySQL database to store family members' personal information and media. The website will be designed to be responsive and accessible, with a simple and intuitive user interface.

## Features:

- Week 1: Design the user interface and wireframe the website.
- Week 2: Develop the registration and login functionality.
- Week 3: Develop the upload functionality.
- Week 4: Implement the search functionality.
- Week 5: Develop the comment functionality.
- Week 6: Add privacy and security measures.
- Week 7: Perform testing and debugging.
- Week 8: Launch the website and perform final testing.

## Budget:
The estimated budget for this project is $150. This includes the cost of server hosting, domain registration, software development, and testing. The budget will be broken down as follows:

Server hosting: $100
Domain registration: $50
