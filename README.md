# family-photo-history
My first person project: to chronicle my families history

Per  my google keep notes that I took while on the phone with my dad:

>I want to create a website to archive and organize Pagadaun/Ortaliza family photos.
>They should be able to be tagged/sorted with the following criteria:
>- Person(s) in photo
>- Date taken
>The goal is to have a site user friendly enough for my elderly relatives and aesthetically pleasing as a photo viewing experience.
>
>Feature list (in order of implementation):
>- photo hosting
>- Sort by date
>- Filter by date range
>- Import date from metadata
>- Optional description
>- Tag people in photo
>- Filter by tagged people
>- Scrapbook (album) feature
>- Video hosting
>- filter by video, photo, or album
>- Family tree 
>- Family member birthday and bios"

This is a fairly rudimentary list. I will start with a proof of concept that is based on

## Proof of concept

 - Will run on my PC through the VScode local live server extension
 - Will use local images from my phone, and potentially polariod scans
 - Possibly a way to upload images? Right now I don't know how to store images and metadata in a database
